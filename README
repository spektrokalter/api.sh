Usage

	api GET business-unit/read-all

	api POST staff/evaluate-business-units.d/nikos

Concept

	Use files to describe requests. Use environment variables,
	which are inherited or set in ~/.apirc or $APIRC, to alter the
	contents of the files.

Files

	~/.apirc

Environment

   APIRC
	Script to source instead of ~/.apirc.  Use for project
	initialization.

Tips

	Storing environment variables in a JSON file allows for
	unobstructed automatization.

Request directory structure

	Can a request directory have subdirectories related to the same
	concrete request? E.g. headers.d/cors, headers.d/auth, etc. Yes,
	in theory.

	The more general question is, by what criteria can the tool
	distinguish between the request directory and a subdirectory
	related to the request? (This could pave the way for certain
	features.)

	I chose not to define such criteria. Instead, it is the user
	who must know what is a request directory and what is not. Thus,
	the user is entirely in control of the "certain features."
